# 30-Days-Of-WebDesign
Repository for everything I learn in HTML and CSS for next 30 days.

## What it is about
The rules of 30 days of Web Design are very simple:

1. Programming for at least 1hour - 2hours a day
2. It has to be for a personal project or personal development.
3. Post somewhere to be held accountable (Instagram, Github, codepen...)
